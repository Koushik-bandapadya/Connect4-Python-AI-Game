Overview
This project consists of developing and implementing a computer program that can play a 
game against a human opponent. You will implement the game of Connect Four either 
individually or as a group. The project will exemplify the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning, and designing good evaluation functions.

Game description: 
Four Connect is also a two-player, fully observable, deterministic, zero-sum game. Players 
take turn in dropping discs from the top of an upright board until one player can connect 
four discs of the same color in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. It is typically 
played in a 7 X 6 board (7 columns wide, 6 rows high).
